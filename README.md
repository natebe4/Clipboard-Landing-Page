### What I learned

This project to me was more of the designing and figuring out aspect to more complex designs, aside from beginner challenges. The code isn't meant to be perfect. It's the learning part of putting the whole thing together, and finding out different ways to make things easier. This was simply put together to be able to explore deeper into this, and learn better ways to manage aspects of the project.

### Continued development

I feel as if this will help greatly on developing, and make a big difference when it comes to the way a page is laid out, and developed. Different ways of managing headings, classes, etc. Going to continue to focus on ways to make the process an easier overall development, and proper.
